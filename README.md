# YmlRecord

YmlRecord is a gem to allow easy instantiating of classes from a yml file and exposing an ActiveRecord-esque api.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yml_record'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yml_record

## Usage

Create an ApplicationYmlRecord model that inherits from YmlRecord::Base
```
  # app/models/application_yml_record.rb
  class ApplicationYmlRecord < YmlRecord::Base; end
```

Create a model that will be backed by a yml data file and inherit from ApplicationYmlRecord.
```
  # app/models/example_model.rb
  class ExampleModel < ApplicationYmlRecord
```

Add a yml file (named the same as your model) to the `config/data/` folder
```
  # config/data/example_model.yml
  - id: 1
    name: one
  - id: 2
    name: two
```

This model can now be used as if it were backed by activerecord and a database table.
N.B: this functionality does not include create or update actions.

```
ExampleModel.all #=> relation of 2 instances
ExampleModel.where(name: 'one') #=> relation of 1 (first) instance
ExampleModel.find(1) #=> first instance of ExampleModel
etc
```

See below for specific functionality implementations.

TODO: document implementation of custom filename  
TODO: document implementation of custom identifier  
TODO: document implementation of scope  
TODO: document implementation of enum  

## Future implementations
TODO: document

- [ ] default boolean methods. Currently need to specifically set up boolean methods.  
- [ ] setting data folder in initializer for gem
- [ ] allow setting of specific data for specific deployments



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
